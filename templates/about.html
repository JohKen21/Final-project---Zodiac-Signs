        zodiac, in astronomy and astrology, a belt around the heavens extending
        9° on either side of the ecliptic, the plane of Earth’s orbit and of the
        Sun’s apparent annual path. The orbits of the Moon and of the principal
        planets also lie entirely within the zodiac. The 12 astrological signs
        of the zodiac are each considered to occupy 1/12 (or 30°) of its great
        circle. These signs no longer correspond to the astronomical
        constellations in which the Sun actually appears. The constellations are
        irregular in size and shape, and the Sun regularly passes through one
        constellation (Ophiuchus) that is not considered a member of the zodiac.

        all videos for this article Because most of the constellations through
        which the ecliptic passes represent animals, the ancient Greeks called
        its zone zōdiakos kyklos, “circle of animals,” or ta zōdia, “the little
        animals.” The size and number of zodiacal constellations varied in
        antiquity and became fixed only with the development of mathematical
        astronomy. The list below gives the constellations of the zodiac, with
        the dates of the Sun’s passage through them in the era when their
        boundaries were fixed. These dates are still used for the astrological
        signs, though precession of the equinoxes has shifted the constellations
        eastward; e.g., on January 1 the direction of the sun is now in
        Sagittarius instead of Capricornus. The history of the symbols is
        unknown; they seem to appear first in Greek manuscripts of the late
        Middle Ages.
